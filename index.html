        Here, <span>FoodHub</span> comes into picture. We came up with an initiative to reduce the food wastage and hunger as much as possible with the goal of zero hunger and responsible consumption and production. We have our outlets in different parts of the country. We are in contact with some banquets. We collect the donated food and distribute it among the people who need it. <br> <br>

        <h4> Here are few steps which we can follow in order to minimize food wastage: <br>
            1) Reduce food waste at home by buying only what you need, planning meals, and storing food properly. <br>
            2) Compost food scraps to create nutrient-rich soil for plants. <br>
            3) Donate extra food to food banks, shelters, and other organizations. <br>
            4) Recycle food packaging and containers.  <br>
            5) Use leftovers creatively in new meals and recipes. <br>
            6) Contact your local government to find out what food waste programs are available in your area. <br> <br>
            
            Solutions for food waste management in India: <br>
           
            1)<span>Recycle by Composting:</span> Food producers will solve 100% of their waste matter issues by merely organizing a good composting strategy. And doing therefore not solely eliminates waste, it saves you cash as a result of you don’t have to be compelled to “outsource” your compost production. <br>

            2)<span>Turn Wasted Food into Animal Feed:</span> Cultivating compost is a method to recycle food, however it also can be drained of the bellies of cows, sheep, pigs, and alternative ethereal (themselves destined to become food). <br>

            3)<span>Use Waste Food to provide Products:</span> From biofuels to liquid fertilizer, there are several helpful merchandises that may be factory-made from bound styles of waste foods, and infrequently “leftovers” of one company might be helpful in another business for the food scrap. <br>

            4)<span>Source Reduction and Food Donation:</span> The easiest method to curtail waste matter is to easily turn out less whenever production is clearly resulting in waste.
